# Simple_LSTM_RNN
This is a very simple model based on the mechanism of LSTM and RNN
# File description
- main.ipynb: where you can run your code to load data, train the model and make prediction
- data_util.py: file for data preprocessing
- model.py: RNN and LSTM models
- airplane.csv: the datasets
- environment.yml: the environment file, you can use this file to create the environment to run this code.
  The usage can be found in https://sachinjose31.medium.com/creating-an-environment-in-anaconda-through-a-yml-file-7e5deeb7676d
  - step 1: go to your conda terminal
  - step 2: conda env create -f <path_to_yaml_file>
  - step 3: conda activate myenv
    Then you can run your code in this envionment
